			<text>The MZ-2500, also known as the Super MZ, is an 8-bit personal computer released on 1 October 1985 as part of the Sharp MZ series. It is a successor to the MZ-2000/2200 and a direct successor to the MZ-80B from the previous generation. The MZ-2000 was a model that was given significant functions, along with a faster processing speed. It is also the final model of the entire 8-bit MZ series with architecture of its kind. It is sometimes referred to as the best 8-bit machine along with the 6809 FM77AV and the MB-S1. In Japanese computer magazines, the MZ-2500 was also called 'The Phoenix'. Its successor was the Sharp MZ-2861 which has a compatible mode and a newly developed 16-bit mode. The development code is LEY and can be found in the circuit diagram.</text>
